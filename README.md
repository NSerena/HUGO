# HUGO
This is my first web page made with HUGO, .md and html for the most part.
This project, which is a discography web page of a music band has a main screen,
with all the discs displayed and a working contact form
It is full in Spanish because it was an assignment.

## Instalation
### Linux
brew install hugo
### Windows
choco install hugo -confirm (Chocolatey)
scoop install hugo (Scoop)

cd HUGO-main

It will open in http://localhost:1313
